# aternosapi(-rust)
It's my C++ project aternosapi, but rewritten in Rust. aternosapi is a library meant to control aternos-hosted servers programmatically using Rust. Remember, this **breaks Aternos' TOS for automation**, you can be banned.
### Current features
* Log into an existing aternos account
* List available servers for said account
### Soon-to-be-added features
* Start/stop servers
* Retrieve statuses of servers
* View players inside of server
* Query a specific server to access
